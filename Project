Automation of unmanned railway system using machine learning.
 
The project aids in automating unmanned railway crossing using real time object detection and identification. The proposed system consists of the following parts raspberry pi ,camera module,ultrasonic & pressure sensor, data from railway scheduled timetable and real time api calls,motor driver circuit etcâ€¦.
Working
Raspberry pi will be having a pretrained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network Model ) model,this data model is developed from realtime images from camera modules attached to raspberry pi , ultrasonic and pressure sensor placed in railway tracks , irctc scheduled timetable ,realtime api calls
When the pretrained CNN model receives a real time image from the camera module the object gets detected as train and a real time decision is made  and the output is passed on to the motor driver circuit which is connected to the level cross ,thus the system gets automated .
